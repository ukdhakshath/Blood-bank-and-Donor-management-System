# Blood Bank and Donor Management System
Introduction
The Blood Bank and Donor Management System is a PHP and MySQL-based software solution designed to facilitate the management of blood donations, donors' information, and blood inventory within a blood bank or a similar healthcare facility. This system aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly interface for both administrators and donors to streamline the donation process and ensure adequate blood supply.

Blood Inventory Management: Tracks the inventory of blood units including type, quantity, and expiry dates. Alerts administrators when blood supplies are low.
Donor Management: Maintains a database of donor information, including donation history, eligibility status, and contact details.
Blood Compatibility: Ensures compatibility between donor blood types and recipient blood types for safe transfusions.
Reporting: Generates reports on blood inventory levels, donor demographics, and donation trends for analysis and decision-making.
